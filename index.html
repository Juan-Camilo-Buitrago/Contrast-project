      <p><strong>In a seminal booklet that he both designed and wrote, Carl Dair showed how in typography, as in music, harmony and contrast are the keys to composition.</strong></p>

      <p>The late Canadian typographer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Dair" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carl Dair</a> was one of the great typographic designers of the 1950s and 1960s, and he may have been the best of them all at explaining the nature of typography. In coordinated projects that he both wrote and designed, he managed to describe -- and show -- the ways in which manipulating and using type make typography happen.</p>

      <p>Dair is the very epitome of what I mean when I say "typographer": someone who designs with type, not just a fancy typesetter, but someone who uses type, in all its variations, as the principal element of design. Since type carries meaning, the practice of typography requires a designer who cares about the words themselves. It requires someone who cares enough, and is skillful enough, to make the type express that meaning, rather than serve as simply eye-catching decoration.</p>

      <p>Carl Dair's book "Design With Type" (originally published in 1952; revised and expanded in 1967) is deservedly still in print, even though the technology that he used and described has long been outdated. The practicalities of setting type in metal are no longer the practicalities we have to deal with; but the visual relationships between letters, which Dair showed and explained so graphically in his book, haven't changed at all.</p>

      <h2>Harmony and Contrast</h2>
      <p>The heart of Carl Dair's teaching -- the thing that I keep pointing people to, and the most valuable thing I myself learned from his work -- is the subject of "A Typographic Quest" No. 5:</p>

      <blockquote>
        "Typographic Contrast." In a virtuoso performance, Dair shows exactly how designers use different kinds of visual contrast to make design work and meaning pop out -- clearly and unambiguously, and with flair. To make his point, he compares typography to music.
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Seven Kinds of Contrast</h2>
      <p>Dair first explains the "elements of harmony" (a consistent relationship between the black strokes of the letters on a page and the space around them; and any rules, frames, or decorations being similar in style to the type), then goes on to show seven different kinds of contrast.</p>

      <ul class="principles">
        <li>Contrast of Size</li>
        <li>Contrast of Weight</li>
        <li>Contrast of Form</li>
        <li>Contrast of Structure</li>
        <li>Contrast of Texture</li>
        <li>Contrast of Color</li>
        <li>Contrast of Direction</li>
        <li>Other Types of Contrast</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Contrast of Size</h3>
      <p>The first and most basic contrast is size. "A simple but dramatic contrast of size," says Dair, "provides a point to which the reader's attention is drawn..."</p>

      <h3>Contrast of Weight</h3>
      <p>The second most obvious contrast is of weight: bold type stands out in the middle of lighter type of the same style. As Dair points out, "Not only types of varying weight, but other typographic material such as rules, spots, squares, etc., can be called into service to provide a heavy area for a powerful point of visual attraction or emphasis."</p>

      <h3>Contrast of Form</h3>
      <p>By "form," Dair means the distinction between a capital letter and its lowercase equivalent, or a roman letter and its italic variant...</p>

      <h3>Contrast of Structure</h3>
      <p>By "structure," Dair means the different letterforms of different kinds of typefaces -- a monoline sans serif vs. a high-contrast modern...</p>

      <h3>Contrast of Texture</h3>
      <p>Put all these things together, and apply them to a block of text on a page, and you come to the contrast of texture...</p>

      <h3>Contrast of Color</h3>
      <p>Dair's sixth contrast is color -- and he warns that a second color is usually less emphatic than plain black on white (or white on black)...</p>

      <h3>Contrast of Direction</h3>
      <p>The last of Dair's seven kinds of contrast is the contrast of direction: the opposition between vertical and horizontal, and the angles in between.</p>

      <h3>Other Types of Contrast</h3>
      <p>There are other kinds of contrast, less clearly dependent on the type itself. Dair mentions "contrast by isolation," i.e., putting a word or phrase in an isolated position away from the other elements on the page, to make it stand out  (I think of this as a contrast of position.) And he suggests other kinds of non-typographic contrast, such as mixing paper stocks, embossing, and using contrasting matte or gloss inks. He also points out that illustrations, especially line art, may be in harmony with the type on the same page or may contrast with it completely.</p>

        <p>Finally, Dair takes time to say a little about rhythm ("in typography, it consists of intervals of space") and about the power of "interrupted rhythm" ("the impact derives not from the fact that the unexpected happens, but rather that the expected does not happen").</p>

        <p>Most of the time, we use more than one kind of contrast together, in order to make the differences between visual elements even more obvious. We can use all of Dair's seven kinds of contrast at once, if we're skillful; he refers to this as typographic "chords." (One of the chapter titles in "Design With Type" is "Multiplying the Contrasts.") But breaking them down like this into simple oppositions makes it easier to use them consciously; it keeps us from getting our layouts all muddied up through trying to change too many things at once without thinking about what we're doing. I've found Carl Dair's analysis of typographic contrast -- and especially the visual flair with which he presents it -- an invaluable tool in the practice  of graphic design.</p>
